Jenkins is running on AWS 
Please visit the server at http://18.133.77.29:8080/

Please run the pipeline "wipro-deploy" to validate compliance with requirements. 
The loadbalancer DNS name will be outputted at the end of the console output. 
This can be used to verify the running application.

In order to destroy the infrastructure that's been built, 
simply re-run the pipeline and click on "Abort" and it will delete everything.

In order to run this in your own account, the only change required would to update the AWS secret and access keys 
under Credentials with yours.
