I've got Jenkins running on AWS

Please run the pipeline "wipro-deploy" to validate compliance with requirements. 
The loadbalancer DNS name will be outputted at the end of the console output. 

Please give it a couple of minutes after deployment before checking.

The DNS name will be used to verify that the application is running and being served from the loadbalancer via a 
round-robin strategy.

In order to destroy the infrastructure that's been built, 
simply re-run the pipeline and on the last stage, click on "Abort" and it will delete everything.

I have included my terraform tfvars (without any sensitive information) in source control, just to make your deployment of this infrastructure
easier.
Statefile is stored remotely in Consul as the back-end.

I do hope that this meets your requirements.

Regards,
Akin Jimoh.
